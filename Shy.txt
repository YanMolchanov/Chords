[Verse]

Dm            C                  Gm              Dm

I can see how you are beautiful, can you feel my eyes on you,

Bb          C            Dsus2 - Dm

I'm shy and turn my head away

Dm              C                Gm                 Dm

Working late in diner Citylight, I see that you get home alright

Bb             C                 Bb              C

Make sure that you can't see me, hoping you will see me



A             Dm                Bb

Sometimes I'm wondering why you look me and you blink your eye

C            Dm             Bb

You can't be acting like my Dana (can you)

C            Dm              Bb                Gm

I see you in Citylight diner serving all those meals and then

C                 Dm            Bb    C

I see reflections of me in your eyes, oh please



Bb   C  Dm  Bb   C    Dm

Talk to me, show some pity

Bb        C     A          Dm

You touch me in many, many ways

Bb          C         Dm

But I'm shy can't you see



Dm                    C                    Gm              Dm

Obsessed by you, your looks, well, anyway "I would any day die for you",

Bb               C      Dsus2 - Dm

I write on paper erased away

Dm             C                Gm                 Dm

Still I sit in diner Citylight, drinking coffee or reading lies

Bb               C              Bb                C

Turn my head and I can see you, could that really be you



A             Dm                Bb

Sometimes I'm wondering why you look me and you blink your eye

C            Dm             Bb

You can't be acting like my Dana (can you)

C          Dm                  Bb              Gm

I see your beautiful smile and I would like to run away from

C           Dm            Bb    C

Reflections of me in your eyes, oh please



Bb   C  Dm  Bb   C    Dm

Talk to me, show some pity

Bb        C     A          Dm

You touch me in many, many ways

Bb          C         Dm

But I'm shy can't you see



C D/F# Gm             Eb               F

I see, can't have you, can't leave you there 'cos I must sometimes see you

Gm          Eb         C           F

And I don't understand how you can keep me in chains

Gm         Eb         F                       Gm           Eb

And every waking hour, I feel you taking power from me and I can't leave

C             F       D   

Repeating the scenery over again
