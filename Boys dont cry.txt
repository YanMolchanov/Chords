A                    Bm     
I would say I’m sorry
        C#m                         D
If I thought that it would change your mind
A                      Bm
But I know that this time
      C#m
I’ve said too much
        D
Been too unkind 

C#m              Bm
     I try to laugh about it
C#m                     Bm
Cover it all up with lies
C#m
     I try and
Bm
Laugh about it
C#m                        Bm
Hiding the tears in my eyes
                  A Bm C#m D D C#m Bm A
'cause boys don’t cry
 A     Bm   C#m D D C#m Bm A 
Boys don’t cry 

A                  Bm
I would break down at your feet
    C#m              
And beg forgiveness
D
Plead with you
A
But I know that
Bm
It’s too late
    C#m                  D
And now there’s nothing I can do 
A               Bm
   So I try to laugh about it
A                       Bm
Cover it all up with lies
A
I try to
Bm
laugh about it
A                      Bm
Hiding the tears in my eyes
